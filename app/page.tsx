      I live in Seattle and work in solutions engineering. I’m passionate about building meaningful relationships and bread. <br></br><br></br>

When I’m not working, I can be found cooking, painting, climbing, reading literature on mental health, and showing my husband where that thing is that he couldn’t find.<br></br><br></br>

Welcome to my personal site, a cozy corner where I write about things that interest me or what's going on in my life. Pull up a chair, grab a (digital) cookie, and sign my guestbook if you want to share any thoughts, feelings, or just say hello.
